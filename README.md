# ChainSaaS

A blockchain-powered platform for decentralized SaaS subscriptions, enabling transparent, user-controlled access to software services with automated payments, cancellations, and revenue sharing — all on-chain. This solves real-world problems in traditional SaaS like opaque billing, difficult cancellations, vendor lock-in, and lack of user governance by leveraging Web3 for trustless, verifiable subscriptions.

---

## Overview

ChainSaaS consists of four main smart contracts that together form a decentralized, transparent, and user-centric ecosystem for SaaS providers and subscribers:

1. **Subscription Token Contract** – Issues and manages subscription tokens for access to services.
2. **Access NFT Contract** – Handles NFT-based access keys for software features and tiers.
3. **Payment Router Contract** – Automates subscription payments, refunds, and revenue distribution.
4. **Governance DAO Contract** – Enables subscribers to vote on platform upgrades and fee structures.

## Features

- **Token-based subscriptions** with automatic renewals and easy cancellations  
- **NFT access keys** that grant tiered software features without central servers  
- **Automated payment routing** for transparent revenue splits between providers and users  
- **DAO governance** for community-driven decisions on platform rules  
- **On-chain verification** of subscription status and usage  
- **Refund mechanisms** for prorated cancellations  
- **Integration hooks** for off-chain SaaS tools via oracles
